Hi [NAME],

We’re working with [AGENCY] to understand [TOPIC or ACTION], especially how technology might play into it. As part of this, we want to understand more about your work as a [JOB TITLE], and how technology, among other things, supported or didn’t support you in your role.

We’d like to talk for about 45-60 minutes, and our questions will be a little bit wide-ranging. We’d be take notes that will only be shared with our research team.

Let us know a time that would work best for you, and we'll schedule a time and send you over a link to a Google Hangout or ZOOM

All the best,
```
