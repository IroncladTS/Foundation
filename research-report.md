## Research Methods

We decided to conduct phone interviews, as they would be easier to schedule than face-to-face meetings, and we weren’t constrained by agencies’ video capabilities (if we were to do video chatting).

Our main goal was to ensure our participants knew we weren’t trying to link their statements back to their agency or specifically quote them by name for this project, so we reassured them at the beginnings of the calls. If they were able to speak candidly, we knew we’d uncover far better information.

We decided to make the calls 60 minutes long, as 30 minutes didn’t seem enough time to explore interesting bits of information we may uncover during the calls. But, we also knew some interviews may be completed in less amount of time, and that was ok with us. We would judge the interview stopping point, as the time when the conversation stopped flowing effortlessly.
