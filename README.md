### Key templates
- [Research Goals](research-goals.md) — A template to help you define the questions you're seeking to answer, and the assumptions you'll make going into a project like this.
- [Research Report](research-report.md) — An outline for a research report that will help you explain the questions set out to answer, who you talked to, and what you learned about their situations in relation to this specific problem.
